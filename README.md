You must have observed that the photo apps in your phone are able to extract the people involved in
a picture and cluster them accordingly(same person together). You might be wondering how this
works and this task aims to do just that.
We have provided a dataset consisting of peopleâ€™s faces over a 2 year time. This data contains 2
types of image pairs: Positive Pair and Negative Pair (Positive Pair have both images of
the same person while the Negative Pair have the images of different persons). Your task is to
visualize the dataset and train a model which will be able to analyze a pair of images and predict
whether they are the same person or not.
